# Probability-and-Mathematic-Expressions


This repo will be covering probability and mathematic expressions on a basic level, these are meant for when programs are written, The process of researching these things can be greatly reduced.


### Probability,

Probability is the process of chance, and how it can affect the chances of certain events happening, for example if someone rolls a 6 sided dice, the probability of the dice landing on 1 is a 1/6 chance. If someone draws a card from full deck, the probability that their card will be red is an 27/54 chance to draw it. However these numbers are able to be simplified down to a 1/2 chance otherwise known as a half chance as they scale down accordingly.

### Calculating the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of a given pair of numbers.

The Greatest Common Divisor or otherwise known as the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers that aren't negative is the largest positive number that divides both numbers without a remainder, this excluded any form of decimal number. This method of maths is very useful for finding the simplist form for fractions as it allows the numbers to be reduced to a number that is easier to digest. For example, 

### TWO NUMBERS 12 AND 15

The original fraction would be 12/15

The common factors of these numbers are,
1 and 3,
#### We pick the highest common factor which is 3 in this case

By multiplying the number 3 a certain amount of times we can get our lowest common divisor, 3 goes into 12, 4 times and 5 for 15. 
#### This means the new fraction is 4/5 instead of 12/15


### Arithmetic and geometric progressions

In order to sum these progessions, first a number must be taken, after the value has been chosen it must be multiplied by itself, whilst doing this the number must then be added by itself. This will loop and won't stop until a set value appearsm this means it can go on for any amount of time. After this has been done it will just get the final values and display them presenting the progression of values. The only difference between Geometric and Arithmetic is that Geometric is times whereas Arithmetic is addition.
